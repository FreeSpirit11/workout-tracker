## Habit Tracker - Calorie and Exercise Logger

This Python script uses the Nutritionix API to track daily exercises and calories consumed, and logs them to a Google Sheet.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Python
2. Get an API key from the Nutritionix API (APP_ID and API_KEY).
3. Obtain a token for accessing the Google Sheets API (TOKEN).
4. Set up the Google Sheets API (SHEET_ENDPOINT).
5. Define your gender, weight (in kg), height (in cm), and age.
6. Run the script and input your exercise details.

## Instructions
1. Replace the placeholders with your own API keys, token, and endpoints.
2. Modify the GENDER, WEIGHT_KG, HEIGHT_CM, and AGE with your personal information.
3. Execute the script and enter the exercise you did . e.g. I did cycling today for two hours and yoga for 1 hour.
4. The script will log your exercise details along with calories and time to your Google Sheet.

## Note
- Ensure your API keys, tokens, and personal information are kept private and secure.
- The SHEET_ENDPOINT and EXERCISE_ENDPOINT URLs must be correctly set for the script to function.
